📂Front-End Responsive (Kevin Powell)-
                  📝 Lecture- 
                            Day 1 || Using percentages & avoiding heights
                  📝 Challenge-
                            i) set the child element's width to half of it's parent element, but not using fixed units.
                            ii) Cancel the text overflow from the container.
                              (just remove the height value)
                  📝 NOTES-
                            ✒ webiste is responive by default
                            ✒ Restrict using Fixed units (px).
                            ✒ Use % , rem  and em units.
                            ✒ It's good idea to avoid heights.
